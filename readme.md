# Simple Escrow Contract

## 1. Project Title
**Simple Escrow Contract in Clarity**

## 2. Project Description
This is a minimal implementation of an escrow service on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. It allows a buyer to deposit STX into an escrow account and release the funds to a seller upon approval. The contract ensures that funds are securely held until explicitly released.

## 3. Project Vision
The vision is to provide a secure and trustless way for buyers and sellers to transact without relying on a third party. This contract ensures that the seller gets paid only when the buyer is satisfied, and the funds are locked safely in the meantime.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add dispute resolution with a third-party mediator.
- Allow the seller to refund the buyer.
- Add deadlines and automatic refunds if the buyer does not approve in time.
- Support multiple escrows in a single contract.
- Include events/logging for deposits and releases.

## 5. Contract Address
Once deployed on the Stacks blockchain, the contract will have an address in the format:
